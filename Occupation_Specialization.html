                The ancient Egyptians had jobs just like us today but the only difference is when it comes to how they are paid, due to them not having a cash economy before the coming of the Persians that took place 525 BCE, the workers like the farmers were helping the government and in return the government were doing the same thing.

                Some of the ancient jobs were farmers, soldiers, craftsmans, and builders. (“Egyptian Social Classes and Society: How Exactly Did It Work? - History”)
