        <h1><u>Where</u></h1>
        <h3>The old kingdom was known to have been built along the the Nile River</h3>
        <h1><u>Why</u></h1>
        <h3>The annual flooding of the Nile was providing a really good soil that was heavily used <br> ancient Egypt for agriculture. This really helps them stay stable and not go around every year</h3>
