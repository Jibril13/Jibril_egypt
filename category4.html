        <p>The old kingdom of egypt had one of the most important centers in Nubia which was a big territory that was located in the south of Egypt, besides the Nile,
            <br>This was estimated to have happened 2613-1782 BCE (More then 800 years).  
         The Egyptian was calling it Yam, it was described as a resource for ivory gold, and wood. <br>

         <p>agriculture was the main trade of the ancient egyptian because the nile river was providing really fertile soil, some examples are wheat, barley and flax</p>
